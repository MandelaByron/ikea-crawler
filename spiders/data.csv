To prevent your child from getting their head stuck, and avoiding serious injury, the distance between the bed and the wall must always be less than 6.5 cm or greater than 23 cm. When the bed is used as a loft bed, it is recommended for ages from 6 years. High beds and the upper bed of bunk or loft beds are not suitable for children under 6 years due to the risk of injury from falls. Long Term Benefits The low KURA bed is ideal for young children. But it also ""grows"" with your kids. Turn it upside down and there's room for a den below and lots of fun and games. The bed is easy for two adults to lift.The canopy fits KURA high and low. After all, who doesn't dream of sleeping beneath the sky? What a dream to sleep in your own house and bed. Closing doors and windows, climbing the ladder and then waving goodnight through the skylight. Experience all of this with KURA bed tent with curtain and KURA bed in its highest position. How can a children’s bed be something more than a safe place to sleep? Can it even inspire play? This is what designers Tina Christensen and Kai Legaard were thinking when they started sketching KURA reversible bed more than 15 years ago. Since then, we've developed various tents that have transformed the bed frame into a house, a tree house and a radiant starry sky. It’s resulted in children around the world using KURA as their own nook to play and sleep in. With KURA reversible bed, we wanted to make a children's bed that inspires play and is more than a place to sleep. It resulted in a bed which has been used by children around the world for over 15 years as a nook with lots of room for play.

They also like to move around in bed after you’ve turned off the lights. That’s why we have strict construction requirements. We also test our bunk beds thoroughly to ensure they are strong, durable and safe for children. For instance, the guardrails are set to prevent a child from slipping through. There is only one opening in the guardrails, reducing the risk of falling from the upper bed. Also, the ladder steps are evenly spaced to make climbing up and down easier. Upper bed is not suitable for children under 6 years. Steel has unique characteristics when it is stretched and shaped since it remains strong. It provides strength to everything from skyscrapers and cars to bed frames and outdoor furniture.

Classic button detailing makes the headboard eye-catching in any bedroom. The upholstery is soft to the touch and makes bedtime even cosier. The solid wooden legs are strong and sturdy – and complement the classic design. Create a coordinated bedroom by combining this bed frame with other furniture from the IDANÄS series. Easy to put together thanks to a simplified assembly process with fewer steps and fittings. GUNNARED fabric in dark grey is durable and gives the bedroom a timeless style. There’s plenty of space under the bed for storage boxes - perfect for storing extra quilts and pillows. You can easily vacuum under the bed frame to keep the space clean and dust-free. Adjustable bed sides allow you to use mattresses of different thicknesses. Good to know Midbeam and slatted bed base are included. Mattress and bedlinen are sold separately. The back of the headboard is finished with a black non-woven material. This cover’s ability to resist abrasion has been tested to handle 50,000 cycles. 15,000 cycles or more is suitable for furniture used every day at home. Over 30,000 cycles means a good ability to resist abrasion. The cover has a lightfastness level of 5-6 (the ability to resist colour fading) on a scale of 1 to 8. According to industry standards, a lightfastness level of 4 or higher is suitable for home use. Long Term Benefits Polyester is a durable, quick-drying and insulating material that is optimal to use for textiles and as filling in pillows, quilts and furniture. The material is made from crude oil – a limited resource. Since IKEA doesn’t want to contribute to more virgin oil being used, we are now gradually switching to recycled and traceable polyester from sources like PET bottles. What’s nice is that polyester can be recycled over and over, without changing or losing its great qualities. “Nowadays, the bed is not only a place where you sleep, but also work, study, watch TV series – and socialise digitally with friends and family. That’s why one of my ideas with IDANÄS upholstered bed frame was to make the sloping headboard as comfy as the backrest of a sofa. Another that it should give a calm and cosy impression, but still feel light, stylish and elegant. Most of all, I hope many people will love this piece of furniture and spend a lot of time in it!” Care Instructions Do not wash. Do not bleach. Do not tumble dry. Do not iron. Do not dryclean.

Long Term Benefits ""When I designed LEIRVIK bed frame I was inspired by the almost limitless possibilities metal gives to combine soft organic forms with straight, simple ones. My biggest challenge was the high headboard, which I finally decided to make in two parts to simplify transport. Most fun was shaping the knobs, legs and details directly at the lathe machine. I followed my instincts and made them without using drawings. I hope the bed will appeal to everyone who dreams of a romantic bedroom."" We always strive to make our furniture better, that’s why we regularly test our products and get feedback from our customers on what they think of them. Many love the look of LEIRVIK bed frame, but we’ve also been told that it can be improved. So now we’ve updated the design in different ways to make it even better. We’ve made the bed more stable, quieter when moving around in it – and also easier to assemble. Everything to help you sleep better!

A cover that withstands 15,000 cycles or more is suitable for furniture that should withstand everyday use in the home. The cover has a lightfastness level of 5 (the ability to resist colour fading) on a scale of 1 to 8. According to industry standards, a lightfastness level of 4 or higher is suitable for home use. The velvet reflects light in a characteristic way which may make the colour appear as if it changes. Small fibres may appear on velvet. It happens naturally and they disappear over time and can also be removed with a garment roll. Press marks that may appear on the velvet usually disappear after some time. With your hand, you can gently stroke in the direction of the pile or use a clothes brush. You can also use the vacuum cleaner with the soft nozzle.

I hope that TUFJORD will be a favourite place in your home, making life more enjoyable both day and night."" Polyester is a durable, quick-drying and insulating material that is optimal to use for textiles and as filling in pillows, quilts and furniture. The material is made from crude oil – a limited resource. Since IKEA doesn’t want to contribute to more virgin oil being used, we are now gradually switching to recycled and traceable polyester from sources like PET bottles. What’s nice is that polyester can be recycled over and over, without changing or losing its great qualities. Care Instructions Vacuum clean. Wipe clean with a cloth dampened in a mild cleaner.

The wardrobe was given adjustable shelves so that you can maximise your storage. We hope you will enjoying living with this furniture in your home for a long time – regardless of whether you combine them or use them as individual pieces.” Particleboard is made from recycled wood and sawmill waste – so wood pieces with the wrong shade, woodchips and sawdust become a valuable resource instead of being discarded.

The day your sofa or bed needs replacing, the material in the particleboard can be recycled into something entirely new. Care Instructions Wipe clean with a cloth dampened in a mild cleaner.

A durable outer layer of paint or laminate is added to the board.

A veneer is a thin wooden sheet fixed on things like particleboards to add a durable surface and a natural wood look – so we enjoy the many benefits of wood without using solid wood. The most common veneer types are birch, ash, oak and beech and we’ve made a special UV lacquer that helps preserve the wood's natural structure. A benefit with a slightly thicker veneer is how you can repair and sand the surface if it’s damaged to give furniture a longer and more beautiful life.

We hope you will enjoying living with this furniture in your home for a long time – regardless of whether you combine them or use them as individual pieces.” Particleboard is made from recycled wood and sawmill waste – so wood pieces with the wrong shade, woodchips and sawdust become a valuable resource instead of being discarded. We use boards for things like bookcases, bed frames, sofas and kitchen frames. To protect from wear and moisture, we apply varnish, veneer or foil that adds to the furniture's look. The day your sofa or bed needs replacing, the material in the particleboard can be recycled into something entirely new. Care Instructions Wipe clean with a cloth dampened in a mild cleaner.

Max load indicates static weight, in other words the load which the bed withstands if you lie or sit on it. Min. ceiling height required: 240 cm. Long Term Benefits The idea with VITVAL loft bed and bunk bed was to make comfortable and cosy beds for all children who like hanging out with their phones, tablets and friends. But we also wanted to save on nature’s resources and limit the amount of metal in the beds. So how do you achieve two so different goals at the same time? Our solution was to make the bed edges out of a strong polyester fabric that gave the bed a nice and cosy feel ― and we thereby reduced the metal by 30% in each bed. VITVAL loft bed and bunk bed embrace nature’s resources and are made for all children who like hanging out in their beds. And by making the bed edges out of a strong polyester fabric, we could reduce the metal in each bed by 30%. Steel has unique characteristics when it is stretched and shaped since it remains strong. It provides strength to everything from skyscrapers and cars to bed frames and outdoor furniture. The steel industry is moving in the direction of more energy-efficient production and stronger steel qualities. It doesn’t lose any of its properties when recycled and today steel is one of the most recycled materials in the world. Care Instructions Textile Machine wash, max 40°C, normal process.

You can assemble the desk parallel or perpendicula with the bed. If you choose to assemble the desk perpendicular to the bed, you can access the wardrobe from both sides. It´s easy to keep sockets and cables out of sight but close at hand with the cable outlet at the back. To save on our natural resources and make use of as much of the tree as possible, we’ve used sawmill leftovers and scrap wood in the particle boards for SMÅSTAD. Good to know Bed base included. Min. ceiling height required: 240 cm. High beds and the upper bed of bunk or loft beds are not suitable for children under 6 years due to the risk of injury from falls. It is important not to screw hooks or handles onto the bed or hang ropes or belts in which children can get caught when playing. May be completed with doors and drawers, available in different colours. Long Term Benefits During their school years, it becomes increasingly important for children to have their own private nook where they can do arts and crafts, play games and read – on their own or with a friend. But it is not always easy to create this privacy if they share a room with a sibling. With SMÅSTAD loft bed, we wanted to create a room within the room and fit in as many features and as much flexibility as possible in a small space. Under the bed there is a desk and a wardrobe that forms a wall towards the rest of the room, and if you add storage drawers there is plenty of room for clothes and toys. We use constructed boards when manufacturing many of our pieces of furniture, such as tables and wardrobes. They are light yet still stable and strong. Each board has a frame made of chipboard, fibreboard or solid wood, while the inside is a honeycomb filling structure made of mostly recycled paper, which is extra durable thanks to its special construction. The board is then covered with a protective paint, foil or veneer depending on the style wanted. Care Instructions Wipe clean with a damp cloth. Wipe clean with a dry cloth.

Long Term Benefits “Living in a small space often presents big demands for smart storage. That’s what we wanted to solve by creating BRIMNES – a series of functional bedroom furniture with storage in every piece. And at a low price. We made the bed frame with generous drawers and the headboard with room for books, magazine files and holes for cables. The wardrobe was given adjustable shelves so that you can maximise your storage. We hope you will enjoying living with this furniture in your home for a long time – regardless of whether you combine them or use them as individual pieces.” With the BRIMNES bedroom series you can make room for your things - even on a small space. That's because there are 4 large pull-out drawers in the bed frame and the headboard holds the things you need close at hand. Particleboard is made from recycled wood and sawmill waste – so wood pieces with the wrong shade, woodchips and sawdust become a valuable resource instead of being discarded. We use boards for things like bookcases, bed frames, sofas and kitchen frames. To protect from wear and moisture, we apply varnish, veneer or foil that adds to the furniture's look. The day your sofa or bed needs replacing, the material in the particleboard can be recycled into something entirely new. Care Instructions Wipe clean with a cloth dampened in a mild cleaner.

A veneer is a thin wooden sheet fixed on things like particleboards to add a durable surface and a natural wood look – so we enjoy the many benefits of wood without using solid wood. The most common veneer types are birch, ash, oak and beech and we’ve made a special UV lacquer that helps preserve the wood's natural structure. A benefit with a slightly thicker veneer is how you can repair and sand the surface if it’s damaged to give furniture a longer and more beautiful life.

A durable outer layer of paint or laminate is added to the board. The difference between various types of fibreboards, such as HDF and MDF, is mainly the thickness, yet also how impact-resistant they are – and this determines what we use them for. So regardless if it’s a bed, a wardrobe or your new bathroom cabinet, the leftover wooden fibre becomes a resource instead of going to waste.

Can be easily extended by one person. The extra leaf can be stored within easy reach under the table top. The clear-lacquered surface is easy to wipe clean. Good to know Seats 4-6. Only recommended for indoor use. Long Term Benefits Dinners, parties, holidays - extendable tables are ready for anything. Our extendable tables always come with the extension leafs included. You can store the leaves under the table tops when you're not using them. Now that's practical!  If you don't want a loose extension leaf, consider a gateleg table with drop-leafs that fold down when not in use. When your family or friends come to visit, the table grows to fit everyone. When your guests leave, the table returns to its regular size and gives room for other things. ”The round INGATORP extendable table has the same timeless style and carefully designed details as the other tables in the series, but a somewhat stronger expression. It can be easily pulled out and transformed into a large table that seats 6. My idea when I designed the table was to combine traditional details, such as turned legs and fine lines, with smart functions. It makes INGATORP ideal in most situations – and for both parties and everyday.” A veneer is a thin wooden sheet fixed on things like particleboards to add a durable surface and a natural wood look – so we enjoy the many benefits of wood without using solid wood. The most common veneer types are birch, ash, oak and beech and we’ve made a special UV lacquer that helps preserve the wood's natural structure. A benefit with a slightly thicker veneer is how you can repair and sand the surface if it’s damaged to give furniture a longer and more beautiful life.

Easy to assemble as each leg has only one fitting. Ash is a strong hardwood material with a beautiful grain pattern.  As it ages the colour deepens moderately towards a deep straw colour. The table surface in ash veneer and legs in solid birch give a warm, natural feeling to your room. This table has been tested against our strictest standards for stability, durability and safety to withstand everyday use in your home for years. Good to know Seats 4. Only recommended for indoor use. Long Term Benefits Sometimes you need a few more tables than usual, such as when you have family and friends over. LISABO is a perfect party table. It’s easy to store in parts then take out and put together when you need it, as it only has one screw in each leg. LISABO table has an organic shape and bevelled edges, a design that previously could only be made with solid wood. We wanted to find a more environmentally friendly and less expensive solution and developed a technique using solid wood around the edges and wood slats inside the table top. The construction makes the table very strong, so you can use it for many years. The natural beauty comes through thanks to a specially developed lacquer that also makes the surface durable. A real wood feeling and a unique table – without time-consuming upkeep! ""The idea behind LISABO was to create a series with the distinct feeling of wood, a floating expression and durable, easy to assemble construction. We chose a matt lacquer on the ash veneer so the furniture will keep its natural wood feel. The special technique we use allows the tables to be produced without support rails and with slanted edges that give it a handcrafted look. The furniture can be used in different ways and the pieces work great together or individually."" With LISABO table we use wood slats inside the table top and solid wood around the edges. This innovative construction makes the table super strong, so there is no need for support rails underneath. You’ll also find less material, such as fewer metal fittings. All this so you can enjoy great quality at an affordable price. The LISABO series has received one of the world’s finest design awards – Red Dot Design Award. The extremely practical wooden tables suit all rooms in the home and combine modern construction with timeless design. ""The idea behind LISABO was to create a series with the distinct feeling of wood, a floating expression and durable, easy to assemble construction. The round shapes and slanted edges create a hand-crafted look and we chose a matte lacquer on the ash veneer so the furniture will keep its natural wood feel. Each piece in the series work beautifully together or individually.” A veneer is a thin wooden sheet fixed on things like particleboards to add a durable surface and a natural wood look – so we enjoy the many benefits of wood without using solid wood.

Individually wrapped pocket springs isolate movements, so you won´t disturb your partner if you have the habit of moving a lot when sleeping. A thick layer of foam on the top gives you cushioning comfort and support. The pocket springs are designed to help air circulate and regulate your body temperature. The quilted stretch fabric is soft to the touch and moves with you when sleeping. The mattress is roll-packed so it’s easy to carry home and its practical handles on the sides help you when moving the mattress. Choose a pillow you like to go with your mattress in order to really boost your sleep. The springs run from edge to edge to avoid a gap if you want to place two mattresses next to each other. Also, the mattresses fit together seamlessly when placed side by side. The mattress cover is designed to stay firmly in place on the mattress. Only to be used on one side – no need to turn the mattress over. You can sit comfortably on the edge of your bed since the reinforced edge helps keep the mattress firm and even. To keep the mattress fresh, use a textile cleaner suitable for upholstery and vacuum it occasionally. The complete mattress is covered by a 10 year guarantee. You can read about the terms in the guarantee brochure. Good to know The mattress may need about 72 hours to fully regain its shape and comfort after having been roll-packed. Any wrinkles will disappear too. Sometimes the packaging may have given the mattress a noticeable smell which will disappear over a short period of time. 249 springs per square metre in a 90x200 cm mattress. Complete with a mattress base or non-adjustable slatted bed base. Long Term Benefits We’ve rolled around on our mattresses, spilled coffee on them and even lived with them much like many do at home. Not us literally, but our test lab machines. That’s why we know that you can do yoga, work or play with your children on the bed without worrying about the mattress. Your sleep is our priority, along with health and the environment – so we make sure to eliminate all harmful chemicals. A lot can feel uncertain, but you can count on one thing – our mattresses. The comfort zones of our mattresses are simply zones that support your body in different ways to keep your spine aligned and create a good a sleeping position. Slightly softer springs around the hip and shoulder, so they can sink softly into the mattress. And slightly firmer springs where, on the contrary, support is needed – such as for the legs and ankles. The overall effect is that your body does not have to work to find a comfortable position. Just relax and sleep well. 10 YEAR GUARANTEE Care Instructions Do not wash. Clean with upholstery shampoo. Do not bleach. Do not tumble dry. Do not iron. Do not dryclean. Vacuum clean.

Number of Packages: 1 Package No: 1 Width: 69 cm Height: 12 cm Length: 83 cm Weight: 15.40 kg Key features To make the armchair as comfortable as possible for you, we designed it with generous proportions for both the seat and the armrests so they provide good support. You can stack 2 armchairs on top of each other by turning one upside down and positioning it on the other one. The seat has a small edge at the back to keep a chair cushion in place. Made of high-quality, sustainably sourced eucalyptus. Eucalyptus is a durable, hard wood type suitable for outdoor use since it is compact and has a naturally high oil content that helps protect against weather and wind, drying out and mould. The grey-coloured surface in three layers makes the armchair even more durable for outdoor use and also makes it blend into the outdoor surroundings. Plastic feet protect the furniture when in contact with a moist surface. You can create a complete look in a timeless design for your outdoor space by combining the armchair with BONDHOLMEN 2-seat sofa and coffee table. Good to know Cushions are sold separately. May be completed with JÄRPÖN/DUVHOLMEN, FRÖSÖN/DUVHOLMEN, KUDDARNA or HÅLLÖ seat and back cushions. Combines with other products in the BONDHOLMEN series. Only recommended for outdoor use. This chair has been tested for home use and meets the requirements for durability and safety, set forth in the following standards: EN 581. Long Term Benefits Eucalyptus is a durable, hard wood type suitable for outdoor use since it is compact and has a naturally high oil content that helps protect against weather and wind, drying out and mould. For maximum protection it’s pre-treated with wood stain. By re-staining now and then you can enjoy it for many years. How can we make your life at home more comfortable with knowledge of how people lived in the past? One way is to be inspired by traditional handicraft. Like designers Tina Christensen and Kai Legaard when they created BONDHOLMEN. Every detail in the series is a tribute to common sense from past times. It’s many small things together that make the modern outdoor life a little easier and more sustainable. The details in the BONDHOLMEN series are a tribute to handicraft and common sense from past times. It’s many small things that together make the modern outdoor life a little easier and more sustainable. Care Instructions The best way to extend the life of your wooden outdoor furniture is by cleaning it regularly, not leaving it outdoors unprotected more than necessary and to re-stain it on a regular basis. Clean: With a mild soapy solution. Wipe dry with a clean and dry cloth. Maintenance: To prevent the surface from drying out and cracking and moisture from penetrating into the wood we recommend you to re-stain the furniture on a regular basis, for example once or twice a year. Storing: If possible, store in a cool dry place indoors. If the furniture is stored outside, cover it with a waterproof cover. After a rain or snowfall, wipe off excess water or snow from flat surfaces. Allow air to circulate to avoid condensation.

Light, comfortable pieces of furniture that are easy to move around. We used wood and metal, but mixing materials and optimising material use always mean additional challenges to pass tough test requirements and achieve the best possible price. That’s why we’re extra proud to end our 41-year career at IKEA with this series and curious about how it will be received.” Dining tables and chairs have perhaps some of the toughest jobs in the home. Day after day, they stand steady when you have a quick breakfast or the dining area transforms into a study area. Like all our products, SANDSBERG has gone through really tough tests in certified labs. This way you can trust that your furniture meets strict international safety and quality demands – and can handle your everyday life at home. Day after day, they stand there steady when you sit down.

Long Term Benefits A veneer is a thin wooden sheet fixed on things like particleboards to add a durable surface and a natural wood look – so we enjoy the many benefits of wood without using solid wood. The most common veneer types are birch, ash, oak and beech and we’ve made a special UV lacquer that helps preserve the wood's natural structure. A benefit with a slightly thicker veneer is how you can repair and sand the surface if it’s damaged to give furniture a longer and more beautiful life.

As perfluorinated chemicals are non-degradable, it’s better for you and the environment to avoid them.

If you want a special place for make-up and jewellery, you can choose a chest of drawers with a fold-up mirror and jewellery drawer. Matching wardrobes are available in the PAX series. All pieces in the MALM bedroom series - chests of drawers, dressing table, desks and beds - have the same timeless style. They are built to last and designed work together so you can furnish your entire bedroom in the same style. Choose between several veneers and colours. The chests of drawers come in many different sizes, which can be combined into your own personal storage solution. If you like, you can complement with a mirror of your choice and matching wardrobes from the PAX series. A veneer is a thin wooden sheet fixed on things like particleboards to add a durable surface and a natural wood look – so we enjoy the many benefits of wood without using solid wood. The most common veneer types are birch, ash, oak and beech and we’ve made a special UV lacquer that helps preserve the wood's natural structure. A benefit with a slightly thicker veneer is how you can repair and sand the surface if it’s damaged to give furniture a longer and more beautiful life. Care Instructions Wipe clean with a damp cloth. Check regularly that all assembly fastenings are properly tightened and retighten when necessary. Materials and Environmental Responsibility Material Particle- and fibreboard with honeycomb paper filling (100% recycled paper), Ash veneer, Stain, Clear acrylic lacquer, Paper foil, Plastic edging Environmental Responsibility By using particle board with a slice of wood as top layer instead of solid wood only in this product, we use less wood per product. That way, we take better care of resources. We want to have a positive impact on the planet.

I hope that you’ll be able to create a beautiful, harmonious bathroom environment with these accessories, even in small spaces.” Glass is mainly made of sand, soda and lime melted at a high temperature. Tempering or various additives gives you extra-strong and impact-resistant glass that in some cases can be taken straight from freezer to oven without cracking. A big benefit is how glass can be recycled over and over without the quality deteriorating. Also, a lot less energy is needed to melt recycled glass compared to new raw materials. Our goal is to eventually use only recycled glass in our range. Care Instructions Wipe clean with a cloth dampened in a mild cleaner. Wipe dry with a clean cloth.

Laminate is made of resin-impregnated paper, which adds a durable and moisture-resistant surface for countertops. 10 YEAR GUARANTEE Care Instructions Wipe dry with a clean cloth.

Long Term Benefits ""When I designed TÄRNABY I wanted to create a lamp that provides a mood lighting which is soft and warm. I was inspired by old kerosene lamps, and used glass so that the light bulb is visible and becomes a decorative touch, just like the flame in older lamps. I was also inspired by the kerosene lamp’s flexibility in the home. That’s why the brightness can be adjusted with the dimmer on the side ‒ and even though it has a cord, the lamp is easy to place and move around."" TÄRNABY lamp is inspired by traditional kerosene lamps. The visible light bulb emulates a live flame and provides a mood lighting which is soft and warm. Glass is mainly made of sand, soda and lime melted at a high temperature. Tempering or various additives gives you extra-strong and impact-resistant glass that in some cases can be taken straight from freezer to oven without cracking. A big benefit is how glass can be recycled over and over without the quality deteriorating. Also, a lot less energy is needed to melt recycled glass compared to new raw materials. Our goal is to eventually use only recycled glass in our range. Care Instructions Dust the lamp with a duster.

I was inspired by bubbling underwater life and the light reflections created by ripples in water. I want to visualise the same feeling of curiosity, awe and mystery with VINGMAST lamp shade.

Long Term Benefits Viscose is a strong and silky-smooth fibre – even softer than cotton. It is particularly great to use for towels and bed linens since the fibre has a very good ability to absorb moisture and provides a cool, comfortable feeling against the skin.

Here, the light dances around before being directed down to create a nice mood. A diva? Without a doubt. PET plastic is perhaps best known for its use in beverage bottles, yet suits a lot of food and beverage packaging since it’s approved for food contact. Like other plastics, PET is largely made from oil-based raw materials, but today there are even better opportunities to use both renewable raw materials, like corn and sugar cane, and to recycle the plastic several times. At IKEA, recycled PET becomes many things – from storage boxes to soft filling in pillows and quilts. Care Instructions Clean with a duster.

Long Term Benefits PET plastic is perhaps best known for its use in beverage bottles, yet suits a lot of food and beverage packaging since it’s approved for food contact. Like other plastics, PET is largely made from oil-based raw materials, but today there are even better opportunities to use both renewable raw materials, like corn and sugar cane, and to recycle the plastic several times. At IKEA, recycled PET becomes many things – from storage boxes to soft filling in pillows and quilts. Care Instructions Clean with a duster.

The result was the hand-knitted LERGRYN lamp shade with a down-to-earth, authentic and unique look. When the lamp is off, the shade blends into the surroundings.
